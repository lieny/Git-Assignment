This week's assignment is to get set up with node on engineering server and GitHub. It is primarily a technical hurdle that needs to be overcome. If all goes smoothly this should be a 20 minute process, but be prepared for things to not go smoothly. Make sure to get started early on this as it can take awhile to troubleshoot problems.

Last term we made a change and started to run the node on engineering server instead of Amazon server.  It is a new infrastructure.  If you run into any issues, please check/post on Piazza for clarifications.

Requirements:

    Set up Node on Engineering servers
    Start the Node.js process
    Create a GitHub account (and I would highly recommend requesting a student dev pack as well from https://education.github.com/ (Links to an external site.), you get a premium account for free and some other neat software)
    Create a GitHub repository and add some content to it

Deliverables:

    The address where we can access Node on Engineering Servers. (This will be an IP address in the form of http://access.engr.oregonstate.edu:xxxx)
    A link to your GitHub repository where you have added OSU-CS290-Tester as a collaborator
        This repository should have at least 2 files added to it.
